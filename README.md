# Wordle Game in Python

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white)

A simple Wordle clone where the player must guess a five-letter word within six attempts.

Each time the player guesses a letter:
- If the letter is in the word but at the wrong position, it is highlighted **yellow**.
- If the letter is in the correct position, it is highlighted **green**.

After six attempts, the player must have guessed the correct word; otherwise, the game is lost.

This project is designed so that the Python file can be downloaded and executed locally.  
Please make sure to check the `requirements.txt` before running the game.

**Please note that `wordle.py` requires a list of 5-letter words, which is currently only available in German. You can add and/or remove words individually.**
